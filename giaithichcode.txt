We can start with node A and we have 2 paths.

The first is from A to B with a length of 5
And from A to C with length 3.

So we can write in the adjacent list with the visited vertices 2 new vertices (B, C) and the weight to get there.

Then, as said earlier - we will choose the path from A -> C.

When accessing vertex C, we can see that there are 3 different paths:

The first path is C to B
The second path is C to D
The third path is C to E

So write to a list of two new vertices and choose the shortest path as C to B.

Now at B we have 3 lines:

B to D
B to E
And B goes back to C

We choose the shortest path B to D and we update the new weighted list of paths from A to the other vertices.

Now as we can see there is no new path from D to E.

In that case, we go back to the previous vertex to check the shortest path.

Now there is a path of length 4 going to E and a path going to C.

In this case, we choose any path we like.

Finally, we can see that any alternative we take on the path from A to E has the same weight because the shortest paths are recorded in the list.

Finally, we can see all the paths that we have used.
